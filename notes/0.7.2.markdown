* Deprecate Directive.success in favor of Directives.success
* `unfiltered.netty.async.FuturePlan` for intents that respond in a
  Scala Future, avoiding the need to call respond explicitly (as
  required by `async.Plan`)
* More robust handling of request completion in the provided `unfiltered-filter`
  intent in the event that a response function or external servlet component has
  called [ServletResponse#getWriter].
