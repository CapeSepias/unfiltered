### Header Extractor Refactor

This release includes a breaking change to the set of request-header
extractors included with Unfiltered. Named header extractors are now
abstractions of the particular header specifications, so that
non-repeatable string headers extract to a `String` instead of a
`Seq[String]`, date headers extract to a `Date` object, etc.

Applications upgrading from Unfiltered 0.3.x will need to remove a few
calls, for example to `headOption`, to compile against the new version.

### Other Changes

* Published for Scala 2.8.0 - 2.9.0-1. If you're building against
  Scala 2.7.7, stay on Unfiltered 0.3.x.

* Built with sbt 0.10.1

* Jetty and Netty servers now expose url's accessable through their RunnableServer#run method so you can do

    unfiltered.jetty.Http.anylocal.filter(plan).run({ svr =>
        unfiltered.util.Browser.open(svr.url)
    })

* Removed deprecated method `requestURI` and `contextPath` on `HttpRequest`, use `url` instead or the ServletFilter modules `ContextPath` extractor

* Drop side effecting request reading extractors `InStream`, `Read` and `Bytes`. Prefer `Body` methods `stream`, `reader`, and `bytes` instead

* Removed deprecated auxillary `jetty.Http` constructor

* Enable `@tailrec` annotations

* Fix compiler warnings
