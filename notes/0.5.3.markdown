#### Cookies changes

We've added support for the [HttpOnly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#HttpOnly_cookie) and Version, properties of cookies. This change affects the source of extraction of Cookies. Rather than delegating to `HttpRequest`, Cookies are not extracted directly from the headers of an HTTP request on demand. Since this change added two new properties to the Cookie case class this affects any cookie extraction you may be doing.

We have also removed the deprecated methods on `Cookie`: `domain`, `path`, `maxAge`, and `secure` in favor of using built-in support for named arguements provided by case classes

`ResponseCookies` is being deprecated in favor of `SetCookies` which is more inline with the `Set-Cookie` header it wraps.
