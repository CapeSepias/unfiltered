This release includes additions and changes to unfiltered-directives
as well as general housekeeping and bug fixes.

### unfiltered-directives

This module is now fully documented and encouraged for all of your
request validation needs. There are some deprecations: `Path.Intent`
is deprecated in favor of `Directive.Intent.Path`, and `autocommit` is
replaced by a `commit` directive ([pr 179][179]).

There are changes to the `Result` type parameters; these were
generalized so that multiple error responses may be joined into
one. Explicit references to these parameters will need to be updated.

A major addition to directives is support for **validation of request
parameters**. It is designed to be easily extensible, precise, and
convenient. Parameter "interpreters" and their error messages may be
defined inline, or as reusable components of an application.

[Read the new directives documentation][docs] for details and many examples.
