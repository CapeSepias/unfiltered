The major new feature of this release is an **upgrade to
[Netty 4][netty4]** for `unfiltered-netty-*` modules, carried out by
[softprops][softprops].

Support for Netty 3 is not continued on the Unfiltered 0.8.x line. If
you need anything for Netty 3, speak up on the [list][list] and we can
work out an 0.7.x release. (Most modules of Unfiltered 0.7.1 were
built and published for Scala 2.11 on April 20th.)

There's also a bevy of bug fixes and new features, including many from
the [Scala Bug Bash Meetup][bash].
