* [chrislewis][chrislewis] NotFoundHandler added as last in pipeline;
  plans push unhandled requests upstream. Channel handlers plans can
  now be chained like filter plans.

* [softprops][softprops] Refactor of WebSockets interface, now enables
  the use of Unfiltered's request extractors prior to the WebSockets
  handshake. See [the module's readme][websockets] for details and
  examples.

* Compiled, tested, and published for all release versions of Scala
  from 2.7.7 to 2.9.0-1.
