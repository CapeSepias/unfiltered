## New Features

### Multipart POST support for Netty 

This substantial [contribution by g-eorge][up] handles file of uploads
of arbitrary size, as previously supported only for filter plans. See
the [netty-uploads readme][read] for details.

[read]: https://github.com/unfiltered/unfiltered/blob/master/netty-uploads/README.md

### Kits

* [unfiltered.kit.Secure][secure] redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS.
* [unfiltered.kit.Auth][auth] requires basic auth for matching requests.
* unfiltered.kit.AsyncCycle â€” removed this promise/future-aware kit for
  the time being

[secure]: https://github.com/unfiltered/unfiltered/blob/master/library/src/main/scala/kit/secure.scala
[auth]: https://github.com/unfiltered/unfiltered/blob/master/library/src/main/scala/kit/auth.scala

### Extractors

* [unfiltered.request.QueryParams][queryparams] allows access to
  query-string parameters exclusively, doesn't read in the request
  body for POST params
* [unfiltered.request.Charset][charset] The existing extractor yielded
  both the charset string as well as an `HttpRequest` object in the
  older fashion of Unfiltered. This is altered to now only yield the
  charset, which is a **breaking change**. If you see a compilation
  error for a Charset matcher, simply remove the trailing prameter
  in its parameter list.
* [unfiltered.request.{Accept,AcceptCharset,AcceptEncoding,AcceptLanguage}][accept] all behave more correctly thanks to hamnis's 
[content negotiation fixes][conneg].
