This release includes a **refactoring of Jetty and Netty server
builders** (pull request [#242][242]). The new builders use immutable
configuration objects and are more extensible. The old builders have
been deprecated.

Migration in many cases is simply changing to the new `Server`
constructors. Most of the old builder methods exist on the new
builders, although notably `filter` and `handler` are **deprecated in
favor of `plan`**.

Some examples:

    // listen to http on port 8080, all network interfaces
    unfiltered.jetty.Server.http(8080).plan(myFilter).run()

    // listen to http on port 8080, local network interfaces
    unfiltered.jetty.Server.local(8080).plan(myFilter).run()

    // listen to http on some available port, local interfaces
    unfiltered.jetty.Server.anylocal.plan(myFilter).run()

    // listen to http on 80, https on 443, all interfaces
    unfiltered.jetty.Server.http().https(
      keyStorePath=myKeyStorePath, keyStorePassword=myKeyStorePassword
    ).plan(myFilter).run()

    // run a *netty* http server on 80, all interfaces
    unfiltered.netty.Server.http()

Etc!
