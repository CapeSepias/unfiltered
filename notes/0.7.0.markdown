This release includes additions and changes to unfiltered-directives
as well as general housekeeping and bug fixes.

unfiltered-directives

This module is now fully documented and encouraged for all of your
request validation needs. There is one significant deprecation:
`Path.Intent` is deprecated in favor of `Directive.Intent.Path`. There
is also a `Directive.Intent` constructor that works with any
Unfiltered extractor, to ease migration of pattern matched routing.

There have also been changes to the `Result` type parameters; these
were generalized so that multiple error responses may be joined into
one. Explicit references to these parameters will need to be updated.

A major addition to directives is support for **validation of request
parameters**. It is designed to be easily extensible, precise, and
convenient. Parameter "interpreters" and their error messages may be
defined inline, or as reusable components of an application.

Read the new directives documentation for details, and many examples.
